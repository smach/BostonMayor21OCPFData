# BostonMayor21OCPFData
Download Campaign Contribution Data from Mass Office of Campaign and Political Finance

This is a very simple package to download campaign contribution files and return them as a data frame. I wrote it to use with an [automated GitHub Actions project](https://github.com/smach/BostonMayor21OCFPScraper/tree/main), but you are welcome to use it stand-alone if it might be helpful.
